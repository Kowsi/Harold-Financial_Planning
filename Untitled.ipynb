    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer division of Harold's company has decided to offer budgeting and financial planning services to customers. They want to build a report for customers that links to their banking and investment accounts and automatically refreshes the data and charts on login. However, some of the calculations are tricky, and Harold could really use some help connecting the accounts and simulating the retirement investment projections. Luckily, there are APIs available to obtain account transactions and fetch retirement portfolio prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will help Harold complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Budget Analysis with Plaid](#Budget-Analysis)\n",
    "2. [Retirement Planner](#Retirement-Planner)\n",
    "3. [Financial Report](#Financial-Report)\n",

    "#### Budget Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the budget analysis report using the transaction details retrieved from the Plaid API.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Income Analysis using Plaid\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    The Previous year gross income : 7285.0$\n",
    "    The Current monthly income : 500.0$\n",
    "    The Projected yearly income : 6085.0$\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Basic budget analysis on the sandbox transaction and generate the following plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spending Categories Pie Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Expenses per category](Images/spending-pie.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transactions-per-categories\n",

    "* Spending Per Month Bar Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Expenses per month](Images/spending-month.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the API to fetch income data from the sandbox and print the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Last Year's Income Before Tax\n",
    "\n",
    "* Current Monthly Income\n",
    "\n",
    "* Projected Year's Income Before Tax\n",

    "#### Retirement Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will use the IEX API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio and then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. You will then use the Monte Carlo data to answer questions about the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps outlined in the budget starter notebook to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Monte Carlo simulation for the retirement portfolio:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the IEX API to fetch historical closing prices for a traditional 60/40 portfolio using the `SPY` and `AGG` tickers to represent the 60% stocks (SPY) and 40% bonds (AGG).\n",
    "2. Run a Monte Carlo Simulation of 500 runs and 30 years for the 60/40 portfolio and plot the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![monte carlo](Images/monte-carlo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select the ending cumulative returns from the Monte Carlo simulation and calculate the interval values for a 90% confidence interval.\n",
    "4. Using the ending cumulative returns, plot a histogram of the results and plot the 90% confidence interval as vertical lines on the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![histogram](Images/histogram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Retirement Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Monte Carlo simulation data to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the expected cumulative returns at 30 years for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles?\n",
    "2. Given an initial investment of $20,000, what is the expected return in dollars at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles?\n",
    "3. Given the current projected annual income from the Plaid analysis, will a 4% withdrawal rate meet or exceed that value at the 10th percentile? Note: This is basically determining if retirement income is equivalent to current income.\n",
    "4. How would a 50% increase in the initial investment amount affect the 4% retirement withdrawal? In other words, what happens if the initial investment had been bigger?\n",
    "5. (Optional Challenge) Use the Monte Carlo data and calculate the cumulative returns at the 5%, 50%, and 95% quartiles and plot this data as a line chart to see how the cumulative returns change over the life of the investment.\n",

    "#### Financial Report\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will compile a financial report to demo your calculations to the consumer app team. The report should be written as a markdown file and include the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Budget Analysis: Summarize the transaction data from the budget analysis and include images for each chart and table produced.\n",
    "2. Retirement Planning: Summarize the retirement portfolio analysis and include the charts for the Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional Challenge — Early Retirement\n",
    "\n",
    "Harold was really impressed with your work on this planner, but commented that 30 years seems like such a long time to wait to retire! Harold starts wondering if the retirement plan could be adjusted to retire earlier than normal. Try adjusting the portfolio to either include more risk (a higher stock than bond ratio) or to have a larger initial investment and rerun the retirement analysis to see what it would take to retire in five years instead of 30!\n",
